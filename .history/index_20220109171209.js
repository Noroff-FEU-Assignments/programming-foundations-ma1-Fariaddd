// Question 1. Declare and initialise three variables with appropriate names and values. One variable with a number value, one with a boolean value and one with a string value.

//   "One variable with a number value" 

var myFirstNumber = 4;
console.log(myFirstNumber)

// Boolean variable with its value

var isLoggedIn = true;
console.log(isLoggedIn);

// String variable with its value

var myCity = "Oslo"
console.log(myCity);





//  Question(2) Declare two variables. Assign your first name to one of the variables and your last name to the other. Concatenate (join) the variables, assign them to a third variable and console log the value of the third variable.


var myFirstName = "Fariad";
var myLastName = "Yousef";




//// question 3 Check the type of the value "frog" with the typeof operator and assign the result to a variable. Console log the variable value with a label, e.g. “The type of frog is ___”.

var namee = "frog";
typeof (namee);

// joining the strings together

var letters = ("a" + "b" + "c" + "d");
console.log(letters);

// with space 

var petOne = "cat";
var petTow = "dog"

var myPets = petOne + " " + petTow;

console.log(myPets);

// "Boollen variable with its value"
